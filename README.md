# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Home Lab Projects

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Home Lab repository! This is a collection of hands-on labs and write-ups that I’ve completed to sharpen my skills in penetration testing, network defense, firewall configuration, vulnerability analysis, and ethical hacking.

All labs were created using virtual machines running on my personal laptop, including:
- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Metasploitable2 (Victim)
- pfSense (Firewall)
- Windows 10 (Detection/Logging)
